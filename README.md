### How to play
- Clone the repository on your local machine
- With NPM on your global machine, open your terminal and run the command: 
```bash
npm install
```
- This will install all needed packages, mainly ANGULAR
- After all packages are correctly installed, in the terminal, enter:
```bash
ng serve
```
- Keep the server running and access the game through the [local host](http://localhost:4200/) (by default it will be port 4200, if the server opens on another port, simply access the one indicated instead of 4200)
